# Proposed Schedule and Milestones

## Week-by-Week Schedule

### Week 2: 1/13
- Questionnaire/interview pilots about how a system like this could be used.
- Collect initial datasets for object detection and LLM fine-tuning.
- Create a speech-to-text and text-to-speech LLM; determine the base model to use.
- Conduct market research on existing flight copilots and analyze their features.
- Perform a competitive analysis.
- Brainstorm features and value proposition for the solution.
- Create UI mockups on paper.
- Set up the GitHub repository (in-person on Friday).

### Week 3: 1/20
- Fine-tune the LLM with collected data.
- Design a mobile app UI using Figma to integrate the first iteration of the LLM.
- Hold team meetings (Wednesday night and in-person on Friday).
- Begin app development using Xcode or React Native; implement the LLM into the application.
- Push the initial project website to GitHub.
- Collect 50â€“100 datasets for emergency situations.

### Week 4: 1/27
- Create Prototype 1 for basic functionality:
  - Train LLM with checklist data.
  - Develop a mobile UI that integrates the LLM.
  - Build speech-to-text and text-to-speech modules for voice interactions.
- Provide step-by-step guidance for pre-flight and in-flight procedures.
- Start testing Prototype 1 in simulated flight environments.

### Week 5: 2/3
- Acquire Garmin SD card for real-time data collection.
- Expand the LLM dataset to support different airplane models.
- Collect feedback from simulated user interactions.
- Iterate on the application based on feedback.

### Week 6: 2/10
- Integrate Garmin SD card data for real-time context.
- Train the LLM with this data to enable contextual guidance during flight.
- Refine the speech-to-text and text-to-speech systems for improved interaction.
- Prepare for a potential App Store push of the first version.

### Week 7: 2/17
- Develop Prototype 2:
  - Include the LLM trained with real-time data from Garmin SD card.
  - Enhance functionality and user experience.

### Week 8: 2/24
- Conduct simulated flight tests with Prototype 2 to validate its functionality.
- Collect detailed feedback from test users for further refinements.

### Week 9: 3/2
- Implement final refinements to the system based on real-world testing feedback.
- Update the prototype with improved guidance and interaction features.
- Present the project pitch in VC3.

### Week 10: 3/9
- Develop Prototype 3 as the finalized product:
  - Polish all features for deployment readiness.
  - Conduct final testing with the Stanford Flying Club.
- Complete project documentation, including:
  - User manual.
  - Technical specifications.
- Deliver the final presentation, including:
  - Live demonstration.
  - Comprehensive project summary.
